"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Do air purifiers help with mold? This is a question many people ask (and rightfully so!). Mold can cause serious health issues, and having an air purifier to reduce its presence is always a good idea. But do they really work?

Well, the short answer is yes! Air purifiers can be extremely effective at reducing or eliminating mold spores in the air. The filters in these devices remove particles from the air that are too small for us to see but could still be causing harm when breathed in. However, it&#39;s important to note that they won&#39;t prevent new mold growth - you&#39;ll need to take other measures for that (like fixing leaks and keeping your home dry).

Plus, air purifiers don&#39;t always come cheap! That said, if you have an issue with mold in your home then investing in one might be worth it. Not only will it improve your living space&#39;s quality of life but also provide some peace of mind knowing that you&#39;re doing all you can to protect yourself and your family from any negative effects caused by mold spores.

In conclusion, while not foolproof, air purifiers are definitely a good tool for combatting airborne mold particles. It may cost money up front but over time (and with proper maintenance) it could end up being a worthwhile investment that keeps everyone safe and healthy!"

"@type": "Question","name": "Can mold inside walls make you sick?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Can mold inside walls make you sick? This is a question that many people are wondering about, and the answer is (yes!)! Mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments, and when they become airborne, they can cause health problems. Not only can inhaling mold spores make you feel ill, but it can also cause long-term damage to your respiratory system. Even worse, (if) mold grows inside your home&#39;s walls, it can actually penetrate other materials like insulation or wallpaper and spread even further into your living space.
Furthermore, mold growth in your home&#39;s walls may not be immediately noticeable. Therefore, if left unchecked for too long &ndash; which happens more often than not &ndash; the health effects could be quite severe. The most common symptoms associated with exposure to mold indoors are runny nose; wheezing; eye irritation; coughs; skin rashes; asthma attacks; headaches; fatigue; nausea and difficulty breathing. In extreme cases of prolonged exposure where there is a large amount of toxic black mold present on the surfaces of the walls, there is even a risk of developing serious infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis!
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What happens if you breathe in mold for a long time?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Breathin&#39; in mold for long periods of time can have serious consequences! (It) doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s black, white, or green. It can still be a health hazard, causing coughing and chest tightness. Not to mention the potential damage to our lungs!

(Yet), many people are unaware of this risk. They may believe that they&#39;re safe from harm if they don&#39;t touch the mold or clean it up. But that&#39;s not the case; breathing in mold spores is just as dangerous! Inhaling those particles over an extended period of time can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.

Moreover, exposure to high levels of mold has been linked with a variety of other health problems too. People could experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, skin irritation and even depression! Mold also produces toxins which can further compromise our immune systems if we are exposed for too long."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What do you look for in a mold inspection?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold can be a real nuisance, and it&#39;s important to get a thorough inspection (done) to make sure your home is safe and free from this pesky problem. But what do you look for in a mold inspection?

First of all, you want an inspector who knows the signs of mold infestation. They should have experience with identifying potential issues, such as water damage or excessive humidity. A good inspector will also come prepared with the right tools to take samples and detect any hidden mold growth that might not be visible to the naked eye."

<div class="card-body"><p>Do air purifiers help with mold? This is a question many people ask (and rightfully so!). Mold can cause serious health issues, and having an air purifier to reduce its presence is always a good idea. But do they really work?</p>

<p>Well, the short answer is yes! Air purifiers can be extremely effective at reducing or eliminating mold spores in the air. The filters in these devices remove particles from the air that are too small for us to see but could still be causing harm when breathed in. However, it&#39;s important to note that they won&#39;t prevent new mold growth - you&#39;ll need to take other measures for that (like fixing leaks and keeping your home dry).</p>

<p>Plus, air purifiers don&#39;t always come cheap! That said, if you have an issue with mold in your home then investing in one might be worth it. Not only will it improve your living space&#39;s quality of life but also provide some peace of mind knowing that you&#39;re doing all you can to protect yourself and your family from any negative effects caused by mold spores.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while not foolproof, air purifiers are definitely a good tool for combatting airborne mold particles. It may cost money up front but over time (and with proper maintenance) it could end up being a worthwhile investment that keeps everyone safe and healthy!</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Can mold inside walls make you sick? This is a question that many people are wondering about, and the answer is (yes!)! Mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments, and when they become airborne, they can cause health problems. Not only can inhaling mold spores make you feel ill, but it can also cause long-term damage to your respiratory system. Even worse, (if) mold grows inside your home&#39;s walls, it can actually penetrate other materials like insulation or wallpaper and spread even further into your living space.<br />
Furthermore, mold growth in your home&#39;s walls may not be immediately noticeable. Therefore, if left unchecked for too long &ndash; which happens more often than not &ndash; the health effects could be quite severe. The most common symptoms associated with exposure to mold indoors are runny nose; wheezing; eye irritation; coughs; skin rashes; asthma attacks; headaches; fatigue; nausea and difficulty breathing. In extreme cases of prolonged exposure where there is a large amount of toxic black mold present on the surfaces of the walls, there is even a risk of developing serious infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis!<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Breathin&#39; in mold for long periods of time can have serious consequences! (It) doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s black, white, or green. It can still be a health hazard, causing coughing and chest tightness. Not to mention the potential damage to our lungs!</p>

<p>(Yet), many people are unaware of this risk. They may believe that they&#39;re safe from harm if they don&#39;t touch the mold or clean it up. But that&#39;s not the case; breathing in mold spores is just as dangerous! Inhaling those particles over an extended period of time can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.</p>

<p>Moreover, exposure to high levels of mold has been linked with a variety of other health problems too. People could experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, skin irritation and even depression! Mold also produces toxins which can further compromise our immune systems if we are exposed for too long.</p>

A good inspector will also come prepared with the right tools to take samples and detect any hidden mold growth that might not be visible to the naked eye.</p>
