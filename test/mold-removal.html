"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Have you ever wondered (how do you tell) if there is mold in your walls?! It&#39;s a valid concern, and one that can be quite tricky to answer. Mold is difficult to see with the naked eye, so it&#39;s important to know what signs to look for. The first thing (you need to do) is identify potential causes of moisture buildup on your walls. A leaky roof or pipes are common causes of mold growth. If you have had any sort of water damage in the past, it&#39;s worth checking for mold as well.

"@type": "Question","name": "What does mold smell like?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold smell (is) really awful! It smells like a mix of musty, dampness and rotting garbage. It&#39;s not pleasant at all and can be overwhelming to one&#39;s sense of smell. In fact, the odor from mold can oftentimes cause nausea and headaches due to its intensity. Furthermore, the stench of mold is often accompanied by a slimy or fuzzy texture when it is touched. Additionally, this type of fungi can even cause respiratory problems in some cases.

"@type": "Question","name": "How do you test for mold in your house?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Testing for mold in your house can be a stressful experience! It&#39;s important to take the proper steps to ensure you&#39;re getting accurate results. (One) way to do this is through air sampling, which tests the air for mold spores. You&#39;ll need to find an indoor air quality professional who can come out and perform the test. They&#39;ll usually use either a spore trap or settle plate method.
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do you need a mold inspection?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold inspection is very important! (It) can help to identify potential problems in the home, and prevent future issues. It&#39;s essential to have a professional mold inspector come and take a look at your house, as they can detect any possible issues that you may not be aware of. Negatively speaking, if left unchecked, mold growth can lead to significant health hazards and costly repairs.

First off, it&#39;s important to understand what kind of molds are typically found in homes. The most common type is called Cladosporium, which appears as green or black spots on walls or surfaces. Other types include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Stachybotrys Chartarum - all of which can cause serious respiratory problems for those living in the environment.

Furthermore, having a mold inspection done will alert you to any moisture or humidity levels that are too high for your home. High humidity levels create the perfect conditions for mold spores to grow and spread quickly. (It) could mean water damage from leaking pipes or other sources that you don&#39;t know about yet - so discovering this early on is key!

Another great benefit of getting a mold inspection is being able to identify any odors that may point towards an infestation. Musty smells are usually the first sign of trouble - but without proper testing these smells might go unnoticed until its too late! Lastly, if there has been flooding in your area recently then it&#39;s absolutely crucial you get inspected right away; Flood waters often contain fungal spores which can contaminate drywall materials and carpets - leading to a dangerous situation when not dealt with swiftly!"

<div class="card-body"><p>Have you ever wondered (how do you tell) if there is mold in your walls?! It&#39;s a valid concern, and one that can be quite tricky to answer. Mold is difficult to see with the naked eye, so it&#39;s important to know what signs to look for. The first thing (you need to do) is identify potential causes of moisture buildup on your walls. A leaky roof or pipes are common causes of mold growth. If you have had any sort of water damage in the past, it&#39;s worth checking for mold as well.<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Mold inspection is very important! (It) can help to identify potential problems in the home, and prevent future issues. It&#39;s essential to have a professional mold inspector come and take a look at your house, as they can detect any possible issues that you may not be aware of. Negatively speaking, if left unchecked, mold growth can lead to significant health hazards and costly repairs.</p>

<p>First off, it&#39;s important to understand what kind of molds are typically found in homes. The most common type is called Cladosporium, which appears as green or black spots on walls or surfaces. Other types include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Stachybotrys Chartarum - all of which can cause serious respiratory problems for those living in the environment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, having a mold inspection done will alert you to any moisture or humidity levels that are too high for your home. High humidity levels create the perfect conditions for mold spores to grow and spread quickly. (It) could mean water damage from leaking pipes or other sources that you don&#39;t know about yet - so discovering this early on is key!</p>

<p>Another great benefit of getting a mold inspection is being able to identify any odors that may point towards an infestation. Musty smells are usually the first sign of trouble - but without proper testing these smells might go unnoticed until its too late! Lastly, if there has been flooding in your area recently then it&#39;s absolutely crucial you get inspected right away; Flood waters often contain fungal spores which can contaminate drywall materials and carpets - leading to a dangerous situation when not dealt with swiftly!</p>
