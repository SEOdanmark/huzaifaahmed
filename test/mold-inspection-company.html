"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold sickness can be very serious, and it&#39;s important to know the signs (so you can get help right away). One common sign is sneezing and coughing, espeically if these symptoms are ongoing. Another indication might be watery eyes and a runny nose. In more severe cases, people may experince nausea or headaches! Additionally, feeling tired all the time or having difficulty breathing could also be signs of mold sickness.

Moreover, some people might have skin reactions such as redness or itchiness. If this occurs with other symptoms then it could be a sign that mold is present in your environment. Finally, if you notice any strange odors, this could also point to (mold) health problems. These smells will likely seem musty or damp.

So all in all, there are many possible signs of mold sickness. Some of these include coughing and sneezing; watery eyes; headaches; fatigue; difficulty breathing; skin reactions; and weird odors like must and dampness. Thus, it&#39;s crucial to pay attention to your body for any of these indicators - so you can take quick action!"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Do I need to worry about mold? Absolutely! Mold can be a real problem if it&#39;s not taken care of properly. It can cause health problems like asthma, allergies and even respiratory infections in some cases. But that doesn&#39;t mean you have to panic - there are ways to prevent and treat mold.

First off, (it&#39;s important to) make sure you keep your house well-ventilated and dry. Moisture is one of the main causes of mold growth, so try and reduce dampness by using dehumidifiers or air conditioners when necessary. Additionally, check for water leaks frequently. If these aren&#39;t fixed quickly they could lead to more serious issues such as structural damage or worse &ndash; mold growth."

"@type": "Question","name": "What kills mold?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold can be a pesky problem in the home. It&#39;s not only unsightly, but it can cause health issues too! So, knowing what kills mold is (very important). You might think bleach is the answer, but (it isn&#39;t). In fact, bleach won&#39;t even kill existing mold - it&#39;ll just clean off the surface. But don&#39;t worry! There are other things that work much better.
