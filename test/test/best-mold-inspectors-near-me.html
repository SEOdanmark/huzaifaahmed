"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Testing for mold in your house can be a stressful experience! It&#39;s important to take the proper steps to ensure you&#39;re getting accurate results. (One) way to do this is through air sampling, which tests the air for mold spores. You&#39;ll need to find an indoor air quality professional who can come out and perform the test. They&#39;ll usually use either a spore trap or settle plate method.

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Is it bad to sleep with mold in bedroom? (No!) Sleeping with mold in one&#39;s bedroom is not only undesirable but can also be dangerous! Mold spores are microscopic particles that are released into the air and can cause severe respiratory issues. Not only does this make sleeping difficult, but it can also have long-term health impacts. In addition, mold can damage furniture, carpets and other fabrics over time. Furthermore, a damp environment is conducive to the growth of mold and can increase the chance of an infestation.

"@type": "Question","name": "What kills mold?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold can be a pesky problem in the home. It&#39;s not only unsightly, but it can cause health issues too! So, knowing what kills mold is (very important). You might think bleach is the answer, but (it isn&#39;t). In fact, bleach won&#39;t even kill existing mold - it&#39;ll just clean off the surface. But don&#39;t worry! There are other things that work much better.

<div class="card-body"><p>Testing for mold in your house can be a stressful experience! It&#39;s important to take the proper steps to ensure you&#39;re getting accurate results. (One) way to do this is through air sampling, which tests the air for mold spores. You&#39;ll need to find an indoor air quality professional who can come out and perform the test. They&#39;ll usually use either a spore trap or settle plate method.<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Is it bad to sleep with mold in bedroom? (No!) Sleeping with mold in one&#39;s bedroom is not only undesirable but can also be dangerous! Mold spores are microscopic particles that are released into the air and can cause severe respiratory issues. Not only does this make sleeping difficult, but it can also have long-term health impacts. In addition, mold can damage furniture, carpets and other fabrics over time. Furthermore, a damp environment is conducive to the growth of mold and can increase the chance of an infestation.<br />

You might think bleach is the answer, but (it isn&#39;t). In fact, bleach won&#39;t even kill existing mold - it&#39;ll just clean off the surface. But don&#39;t worry! There are other things that work much better.<br />
