"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Can mold inside walls make you sick? This is a question that many people are wondering about, and the answer is (yes!)! Mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments, and when they become airborne, they can cause health problems. Not only can inhaling mold spores make you feel ill, but it can also cause long-term damage to your respiratory system. Even worse, (if) mold grows inside your home&#39;s walls, it can actually penetrate other materials like insulation or wallpaper and spread even further into your living space.
Furthermore, mold growth in your home&#39;s walls may not be immediately noticeable. Therefore, if left unchecked for too long &ndash; which happens more often than not &ndash; the health effects could be quite severe. The most common symptoms associated with exposure to mold indoors are runny nose; wheezing; eye irritation; coughs; skin rashes; asthma attacks; headaches; fatigue; nausea and difficulty breathing. In extreme cases of prolonged exposure where there is a large amount of toxic black mold present on the surfaces of the walls, there is even a risk of developing serious infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis!

"@type": "Question","name": "What removes mold?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold is an issue that many homeowners face(,) and it can be tough to get rid of! It&#39;s important to know how to remove mold properly from your home, so you don&#39;t just mask the problem. The first step in removin&#39; mold is identifying the source of moisture. Moisture can come from leaking pipes, water damage from storms or floods, or high humidity levels. Once you&#39;ve located the source of moisture, the next step is getting rid of the mold itself.
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How do you tell if you have mold in your walls?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Have you ever wondered (how do you tell) if there is mold in your walls?! It&#39;s a valid concern, and one that can be quite tricky to answer. Mold is difficult to see with the naked eye, so it&#39;s important to know what signs to look for. The first thing (you need to do) is identify potential causes of moisture buildup on your walls. A leaky roof or pipes are common causes of mold growth. If you have had any sort of water damage in the past, it&#39;s worth checking for mold as well.
&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What happens if you breathe in mold for a long time?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Breathin&#39; in mold for long periods of time can have serious consequences! (It) doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s black, white, or green. It can still be a health hazard, causing coughing and chest tightness. Not to mention the potential damage to our lungs!

(Yet), many people are unaware of this risk. They may believe that they&#39;re safe from harm if they don&#39;t touch the mold or clean it up. But that&#39;s not the case; breathing in mold spores is just as dangerous! Inhaling those particles over an extended period of time can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.

Moreover, exposure to high levels of mold has been linked with a variety of other health problems too. People could experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, skin irritation and even depression! Mold also produces toxins which can further compromise our immune systems if we are exposed for too long."

If your property requires special attention due to hazardous materials or poor ventilation then these costs can quickly add up too!<br><br>Additionally, if the problem isn't treated properly then this could result in further damage which could end up costing even more money in the long run. It's important to understand the benefits of professional mold inspection services and why they are so important. Above all else, take your time when selecting items for mold remediation so as not to rush into a decision and regret it later down the line!Ultimately, choosing the right products for effective mold removal depends on a few different factors including size of area affected; type of material present; desired outcome; safety considerations; availability; and cost. Different molds need different methods of removal. Additionally, fix any plumbing leaks or water damage quickly – if you don't, it could lead to even more mold issues down the road!<br><br>Cleaning up any spills or wet areas promptly can also help keep mold away.<br><br>  Contact us for a <a class="z8665b7d54984dd0a7121ad1e96c78891" href="mold-inspection.html">mold inspection</a> today!.</div>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Can mold inside walls make you sick? This is a question that many people are wondering about, and the answer is (yes!)! Mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments, and when they become airborne, they can cause health problems. Not only can inhaling mold spores make you feel ill, but it can also cause long-term damage to your respiratory system. Even worse, (if) mold grows inside your home&#39;s walls, it can actually penetrate other materials like insulation or wallpaper and spread even further into your living space.<br />
Furthermore, mold growth in your home&#39;s walls may not be immediately noticeable. Therefore, if left unchecked for too long &ndash; which happens more often than not &ndash; the health effects could be quite severe. The most common symptoms associated with exposure to mold indoors are runny nose; wheezing; eye irritation; coughs; skin rashes; asthma attacks; headaches; fatigue; nausea and difficulty breathing. In extreme cases of prolonged exposure where there is a large amount of toxic black mold present on the surfaces of the walls, there is even a risk of developing serious infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis!<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Mold is an issue that many homeowners face(,) and it can be tough to get rid of! It&#39;s important to know how to remove mold properly from your home, so you don&#39;t just mask the problem. The first step in removin&#39; mold is identifying the source of moisture. Moisture can come from leaking pipes, water damage from storms or floods, or high humidity levels. Once you&#39;ve located the source of moisture, the next step is getting rid of the mold itself.<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Have you ever wondered (how do you tell) if there is mold in your walls?! It&#39;s a valid concern, and one that can be quite tricky to answer. Mold is difficult to see with the naked eye, so it&#39;s important to know what signs to look for. The first thing (you need to do) is identify potential causes of moisture buildup on your walls. A leaky roof or pipes are common causes of mold growth. If you have had any sort of water damage in the past, it&#39;s worth checking for mold as well.<br />

<div class="card-body"><p>Breathin&#39; in mold for long periods of time can have serious consequences! (It) doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s black, white, or green. It can still be a health hazard, causing coughing and chest tightness. Not to mention the potential damage to our lungs!</p>

<p>(Yet), many people are unaware of this risk. They may believe that they&#39;re safe from harm if they don&#39;t touch the mold or clean it up. But that&#39;s not the case; breathing in mold spores is just as dangerous! Inhaling those particles over an extended period of time can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis.</p>

<p>Moreover, exposure to high levels of mold has been linked with a variety of other health problems too. People could experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, skin irritation and even depression! Mold also produces toxins which can further compromise our immune systems if we are exposed for too long.</p>
