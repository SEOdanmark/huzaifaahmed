"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold can be a real nuisance, and it&#39;s important to get a thorough inspection (done) to make sure your home is safe and free from this pesky problem. But what do you look for in a mold inspection?

First of all, you want an inspector who knows the signs of mold infestation. They should have experience with identifying potential issues, such as water damage or excessive humidity. A good inspector will also come prepared with the right tools to take samples and detect any hidden mold growth that might not be visible to the naked eye."

"@type": "Question","name": "What are the signs of mold sickness?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold sickness can be very serious, and it&#39;s important to know the signs (so you can get help right away). One common sign is sneezing and coughing, espeically if these symptoms are ongoing. Another indication might be watery eyes and a runny nose. In more severe cases, people may experince nausea or headaches! Additionally, feeling tired all the time or having difficulty breathing could also be signs of mold sickness.

Moreover, some people might have skin reactions such as redness or itchiness. If this occurs with other symptoms then it could be a sign that mold is present in your environment. Finally, if you notice any strange odors, this could also point to (mold) health problems. These smells will likely seem musty or damp.

So all in all, there are many possible signs of mold sickness. Some of these include coughing and sneezing; watery eyes; headaches; fatigue; difficulty breathing; skin reactions; and weird odors like must and dampness. Thus, it&#39;s crucial to pay attention to your body for any of these indicators - so you can take quick action!"

},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is there a tool to detect mold in walls?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Mold in walls is a serious issue that can cause health problems. (It) Can be difficult to detect, but is there a tool for it? Yes, there are! There are several methods to identify and diagnose mold growth within your walls.

Using a moisture meter might be the most reliable way to detect the presence of mold in walls. This device measures the amount of moisture content in an area and will help you determine if mold is present. It&#39;s important to note that this method only works when the wall has been exposed to water or humidity for some time already - it won&#39;t detect possible future issues."
